* Installation
  Use at own risk!

  1. Clone: git clone git@github.com:AnaRobynn/dotfiles.git
  2. Run ~dotfiles/linkall~
  In case it fails, make sure to create an executable out of linkall: ~chmod +x dotfiles/linkall~

* Improvements
** TODO Create different branches for different systems, which all inherit from the master branch
   Imagine I have some personal config, which I don't want to share with the system I use at work.
   The configuration is always tracking master for changes, but changes made on the "personal"
   are not reflected on the master branch.

   That means I would require an additional step (checking out the correct branch for the correct system)
